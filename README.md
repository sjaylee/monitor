Project name: Monitor  

Project Description: The maintainers want to collect all the messages send by industry machines(such as measurement machine, Microscope etc.) imedicatly. So we use one websocket server to commucate with the machines to receive and store the upload messages, and we use another websocket for maintainers to read the imedicate messages. Of course , the maintainers will receive history message when he/she login. This is the demo for the scenario above.It helps the maintainer to ingest and store the data, finally exposing it to the frontend dev team via a JSON - based API.
